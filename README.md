# NPK Measuring by Arduino Uno R3 WiFi with TCS34725
Software Project for SF342 [Software Construction Project 2] - Thammasat University

## 🌟 Features

This application allows users to measure the levels of Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Potassium (K) using an Arduino Uno R3 with WiFi capabilities. Features include:

- **Real-Time Data Measurement**: Utilizing and controlling the TCS34725 color sensor.
- **Data Storage**: Integration with Firebase for real-time database updates.
- **Web Interface**: A clean web application for data visualization.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes bundled with Node.js)

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/d3ffy/VitaminC.git
cd PakkadApp
npm install
```

### Running the Application

To run the React application locally, use the following command: `bash npm start`

This will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser at `http://localhost:3000`. The page will automatically reload if you make any changes to the code.
